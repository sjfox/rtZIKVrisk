# rtZIKVrisk

This is an R package created to accompany the results from our study [Real-time Zika Risk Assessment in the United States](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/07/056648). It's meant to allow users to recreate the figures from the manuscript, and also allows for one to simulate and analyze zika outbreaks with our framework.

## Installation (R)
To install the package use the [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) package on CRAN.
```r
    install.packages("devtools")
    
    devtools::install_github("sjfox/rtZIKVrisk")
```
